# MQTT-Node-Dart

The repository contains __MQTT__ Client, which received data from a mobile application and restores it on the desktop as files in correspondings project's folders.

## Brief description
__MQTT Node__ is designed to run on the desktop. This console application is controlled by several commands that are entered from the terminal: (__s__[tart]/__f__[inal]/__e__|__x__[xit].

The application is based on the components created earlier and described in https://github.com/mk590901/MQTT-Agent-Dart-Flutter. These components are used as is without changes, taking into account only that the use case is still different, more reminiscent of a server application.

MQTT Node is a mirror of the MQTT Sink Agent (https://github.com/mk590901/mqtt_sink_agent) application and contains a __Scheduler__ component, which receives data from one or more mobile applications and restores it on the desktop as files.
